This is an blank Astro site. I want you to build a world-class landing page that help FC Cincinnati fans learn about Tom Barlow.

Tom is a new addition to the club for the upcoming 2026 MLS season, and many fans may not be familiar with his background, playing style, and what he brings to the team.

I've done some initial research on Tom, which I've attached. Use this, but do some additional research on both Tom, his previous clubs, and FC Cincinnati to create a compelling, polished, world-class landing page.

Use the frontend design skill to make the page visually appealing, easy to consume, and informative.

Design this to match FC Cincinnati's branding, colors, and other styles. It should feel like an official part of the FC Cincinnati website.
